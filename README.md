# Spending Habits Analysis|Credit card transaction

## Introduction
In today's world Credit card transaction analysis is crucial for understanding spending behaviors, detecting fraudulent activities, and optimizing financial decisions based on the given category of data's. In this project I used Excel, SQL and Power BI to analyze credit card transaction data, focusing on customer demographics, transaction trends, extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) and also uncovering valuable trends in customer segmentation.

## Project Objectives:
### Clean and Transform Data :
Prepare the raw data for analysis by converting data types,removing duplicates,ransaction dates and times into appropriate formats and                               transforming dataas required.
### Analyze Spending Behavior:
Calculate total transaction amount, top speending categories, and transaction amount on a daily/weekly basis.
### Segment and Compare Data : 
Analyze transaction based on high spenders vs low spenders,product category and based on location
### Anomaly Detection :
Identify unusual spending behaviors and potential fraud.

## Process:
The Credit card transaction data can be downloaded [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/credit-card-transactions-dataset/data). The total number of rows were 1300354.
### Data cleaning:
#### Tools
To process and clean the data, I picked Excel using Power Qwery.
#### Cleaning data:
Initially I done mergeing the required columns in the power query and decreased the total number of columns. THe change the data type of few columns which were not correct followed by removing duplicates and NULL values in the table. With the help of add column in the query I separated the date/time column and assigned the required data type for the fields. Deleted Unwanted rows which is irrelevant for the analysis.
